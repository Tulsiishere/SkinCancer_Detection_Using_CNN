# Skin_Cancer_Detection_Using_CNN
Skin cancer diagnosis often requires expertise and is time-consuming, leaving room for human error. Automated detection systems can mitigate these issues, and provide scalable diagnostic support. This project addresses the challenge of building a CNN-based classification model to distinguish between skin cancer types from dermoscopic images.
